# Machine Learning Techniques 

The purpose of this notebook is to experiment with several data science concepts, like preparing the data, feature engeneering, or hyperparameter tuning.

This repository contains 3 notebooks:
- Data Preprocessing: data preprocessing is a very important part of machine learning. It is the process of preparing the data for machine learning. The following steps are part of the data preprocessing process:
  - **Data Preparation**: make sure the dataset is ready for machine learning algorithms. Clean the data, remove outliers, handle missing values, etc. 
  - **Feature Engineering**: create new features from the existing features. Sometimes it better to create new features than to use the existing features. 
  - **Feature Selection**: remove features that are not useful to improve the performance of the models
- Model Evaluation & Hyperparameter Tuning
  - **Model Evaluation**: evaluate the performance of the machine learning algorithms, use appropriate metrics, and validation techniques.
  - **Model Selection**: explore the best models for your dataset. Compare the models using cross validation. Record your progress.
  - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: tune the hyperparameters of the models using search methods.
