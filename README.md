# Machine Learning Techniques 

## Part 1 - Dataset & Data Preprocessing
### Dataset Selection
The dataset that is used in this notebooks is suited for a classification or a regression problem and it is a quite large.

### Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a very important part of machine learning. It is the process of preparing the data for machine learning. The following steps are part of the data preprocessing process:

**Data Preparation**: The dataset is ready for machine learning algorithms. Cleaned the data, removed outliers, handled missing values, etc. 

**Feature Engineering**: Created new features from the existing features. Encoded categorical features, normalize features, etc.

**Feature Selection**: Removed features that are not useful to improve the performance of the models.

## Part 2 - Model Evaluation & Hyperparameter Tuning
Build machine learning models for the dataset. You can choose your own target variable and the features that you want. 

**Model Evaluation**: evaluated the performance of the machine learning algorithms, used appropriate metrics, and validation techniques.

**Model Selection**: explored the best models for your dataset. Compared the models using cross validation. Recorded the progress.

**Hyperparameter Tuning**: Tuned the hyperparameters of the models using search methods.
